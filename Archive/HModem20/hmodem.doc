	1  INTRODUCTION
	
	1.1  Why HModem II?
	
	Yes, I know that there are more modem programs for CP/M than you
	can shake a stick at, and that it is probably a waste of time
	writing a new one.  However, I like to write communications
	programs, and besides, I never found one for CP/M that I really
	liked.
	
	Most CP/M communications programs (especially the shareware type)
	come as a general program with overlays for the particular
	computer in use.  This is fine, because it increases the
	portability of the program.  The overlays never seem to take full
	advantage of each machine's capabilities, unfortunately, so the
	smooth user interfaces so prevalent in MS-DOS programs are not
	normally found with CP/M programs unless they are written
	specifically for a particular machine.
	
	For this reason I wrote HModem II to work only on a Heath/Zenith
	Z80 machine with a H-19 type terminal.  The program uses the
	H-19/89 function keys and escape sequences for a simple user
	interface.  It relies upon the Heath tick counter for timing and
	uses a few Z80 instructions.  If there is someone out there who
	still has an original H-8 with the 8080 processor, contact the me
	for an 8080 version.
	
	The other reason I wrote this program was for my sister Linda,
	who is in law school, sees no reason to junk her Z89 at the
	present time, and liked the first version of HModem which I wrote

	HModem II



	several years ago as a programming project.  This new version
	provides her a slicker user interface, the latest file transfer
	protocols, and some new features which rival the best MSDOS
	programs.
	
	
	1.2  Features of HModem II
	
	HModem II is a modern communications program for the Heath/Zenith
	8-bit machines.  It has features not normally found in CP/M modem
	programs.  Because CP/M hardware was never standardized as was
	MS-DOS hardware, user interfaces had to be general, normally
	relying on terminal and command modes which were toggled by
	control characters.  HModem II, because it is written only for
	the H-19/89, uses the function keys for all commands.  This
	allows the user to remain in terminal mode when giving most
	commands.
	
	Key features of HModem II are as follows:
	
	a.  Support for XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM as well as ASCII file
	    transfer protocols.
	
	b.  Dialing directory with settable line parameters, long
	    distance access support, and automatic redial of number
	    lists.
	
	c.  A host mode with password protection.  This is not a full
	    blown BBS, but it works very well as a limited-access host.
	
	d.  Printer echo mode and print screen function.
	
	e.  H-19 keypad macros to simplify logons.
	
	f.  Status bar on screen with "soft" function key labels.
	
	g.  Interrupt-driven input.
	
	h.  Full file transfer progress reporting using H-19 screen
	    control functions.
	
	i.  Selectable automatic capture of screen data to a disk log
	    file.
	
	j.  Full user-configurability of the program.
	
	
	1.3  System Requirements
	
	To use HModem II you must have a Heath or Zenith 8-bit system
	(H8, H/Z89 or equivalent) with a H-19/89 type terminal.  The
	standard version requires a Z-80 processor.  However persons who
	want to use the program with an H8 and the original 8080
	processor may contact the author for a special version.

	HModem II



	
	The I/O card used is a standard Heath or Zenith serial card.  The
	serial port used must be jumpered to enable an interrupt.  HModem
	II is distributed to use interrupt #5, but can be changed by the
	user via the "Configure" function key.  The port address (also
	user-changeable) is set at 330Q in HModem II.  Refer to the
	Heath/Zenith Operation manual for your serial card for
	information on how to set the address and enable the interrupt on
	your serial card.
	
	The program runs fine on machines operating at either 2 or 4
	MHz.  Users running at 2 MHz may find that XON/XOFF must be
	enabled when using 2400 bps modems.  I have not tested HModem II
	with modems faster than 2400 bps.
	
	The program is distributed configured to operate with Hayes-
	compatible modems.  All the modem commands are user-changeable,
	however, so it should work just as well with other "smart"
	modems.  If you have a modem that is not Hayes-compatible, refer
	to your modem manual for the correct command strings to enter. 
	These command strings can be changed using the "Configure"
	function.
	
	The program was developed on a H8 with a Trionyx 64k memory board
	and a Trionyx Z80 cpu board (2 and 4 Mhz).  The disks were
	80-track Z-37's and the terminal was a H-19.  All editing and
	compiling was done on an IBM PC clone with a NEC V-20 processor
	and a hard disk.  The program was also tested on a Z89/Z37 system
	running at 2 Mhz.
	
	
	2  GETTING STARTED
	
	2.1  HModem II Files
	
	As distributed, HModem II consists of 4 files:
	
	a.  HM.COM               the program
	
	b.  HCONFIG.COM          the configuration overlay
	
	c.  HMODEM.HLP           the help file
	
	d.  HMODEM.DOC           this document
	
	These files will be squeezed and stored in a library file called
	HMODEM2.LBR.
	
	During the course of operation, HMODEM II may automatically
	generate the following additional files:
	
	a.  HMODEM.CFG           the configuration data file
	
	b.  HMODEM.LOG           the log file where capture data is saved



	                              - 3 -



	HModem II



	
	c.  HMODEM.MSG           the file for storing incoming messages
	                         in Host mode
	
	d.  HMODEM.FON           the telephone directory
	
	HM.COM, HCONFIG.COM, HM.HLP, and HMODEM.CFG (if it exists) must
	always reside on the default disk when the program is invoked. 
	HMODEM.CFG and HMODEM.FON will always be created on the disk from
	which HM.COM was invoked.  HMODEM.LOG, and HMODEM.MSG will always
	be created on the download default disk which is user-selectable
	in the "Configure" function.  HModem II is distributed with drive
	A: as the default download disk.
	
	
	2.2  Configuration
	
	HModem II is distributed with a standard default configuration
	built in.  When it starts up it looks on the default drive for
	the file HMODEM.CFG.  If this file is not found, HModem II uses
	the standard default configuration.  HMODEM.CFG will not exist
	until you run the program HCONFIG.COM either stand-alone or from
	within HMODEM.  HMODEM.CFG will contain your particular
	configuration settings as well as your keypad macros.  A separate
	file HMODEM.FON is created by the configuration function as the
	dialing directory.
	
	The easiest way to configure HModem II is to press the function
	key marked "CONFIGURE" from within HModem II.  If you want to
	configure HModem II externally, you can run HCONFIG.COM in a
	stand-alone mode by typing "HCONFIG".
	
	
	2.3  Running the Program
	
	2.3.1  Invoking HModem II
	
	To invoke HModem II, type "HM <return>" at the CP/M prompt.  Make
	sure the required files are on the default disk, as mentioned
	above.  The first display will be the introductory screen which
	displays the program name and version.  This screen will remain
	on for 10 seconds or until a key is pressed, whichever occurs
	first.  The program will then initialize itself and the modem and
	display a screen which is blank except for the status bar across
	the bottom and the word "READY" at the top.
	
	At this time you will be in terminal mode.  If you are running
	the program for the first time and you are using a Hayes-
	compatible modem, you may not see characters on the screen when
	you press the keys because the program automatically disables the
	modem echo by sending the default modem initialization string. 
	If you so desire, you can restore the modem echo by typing the
	modem command "ATZ <return>", or by changing the modem
	initialization string under the "Configure" function.

	2.3.2  The Status Bar
	
	The status bar, located on the 25th line of the H-19, provides an
	indication of the current program status.  Whenever HModem II is
	in terminal mode, the status bar is divided into fourteen (14)
	sections providing the following information:
	
	Section 1:  Indicates the command level with the symbols "1>" or
	            "2>".  This is the only part  of the bar that is not
	            in reverse video.
	
	Sections 2 through 10:  Contain labels for the 9 function keys
	            across the top row.  These are different for the two
	            command levels.  The BLUE key will always switch the
	            command level.
	
	Section 11:  Indicates the current line settings.  "12N81" means 
	            1200 bits per second, no parity, 8 bits, 1 stop bit.
	
	Section 12:  Indicates whether the log (capture) mode is enabled.
	            The letters "LG" indicate log is enabled, while two
	            hyphens (--) mean disabled.
	
	Section 13:  Indicates whether printer echo is enabled.  "PR"
	            means enabled, "--" means disabled.
	
	Section 14:  Indicates whether full or half duplex is selected
	            (FDX or HDX).
	
	
	A typical status bar in terminal mode may look like this:
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	1> Rcv Log Dir PrScr Send Hangup Level Help Quit 12N81 LG -- FDX
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When HModem II is not in terminal mode, such as when transferring
	a file or dialing a number, the mode will be indicated on the
	status bar, along with special instructions, such as "Press ESC
	to abort".
	
	
	2.3.3  Line Settings
	
	In order to use HModem II to communicate with a modem or any
	other system, you must have the correct line settings.  The
	eleventh section of the status bar in terminal mode indicates the
	current line settings with a string such as "24E71".  This means,
	for example, 2400 bits per second, even parity, 7 data bits, and
	1 stop bit.  If you are not sure what settings you should use,
	"12N81" There are three (3) ways in which the current settings
	can be changed:

	HModem II



	1.  The "Configure" function:  When the function key labeled
	    "Configure" is pressed, the configure utility is called.  The
	    default line settings are then settable by the user.
	
	2.  The "Dial" function:  Whenever the user dials a number from
	    the dialing directory, the line settings are changed to the
	    ones listed beside the number in the directory.
	
	3.  The "Host" mode:  When the user selects host mode, HModem II
	    sets the parity to "none", the data bits to 8, and the stop
	    bit to 1.  HModem II then matches whatever bit rate the
	    caller is using when a connect is made.  When "Host" mode is
	    exited, the default line settings are re-established.
	
	
	2.3.4  Help Screens
	
	From terminal mode you can get help by pressing the "Help" key. 
	You can page through the help screens using the up-arrow and
	down-arrow keys.
	
	
	2.3.5  Exiting HModem II
	
	The "Quit" key is used for exiting HModem II.  You will be given
	a chance to change your mind before the program exits back to
	CP/M.
	
	
	3  A WORD ABOUT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS
	
	First there was Ward Christenson's XMODEM protocol, which became
	a standard for shareware and public domain file transfer
	protocols.  It worked quite well on early bulletin board systems
	although it was a little cumbersome to use and suffered from a
	vunerability to synchronization errors.  YMODEM was an
	improvement on XMODEM, offering slightly faster transfer and a
	little more ease of use.  ZMODEM, developed by Chuck Forsberg on
	contract to TELENET, was a major step forward, eliminating
	XMODEM's synchronization problem and minimizing the impact of
	network delays.  Chuck placed the C source code for ZMODEM in the
	public domain, which greatly aided me in developing the ZMODEM
	support for HModem II.
	
	HModem II supports all three protocols.  Virtually all bulletin
	boards support XMODEM.  Many also support YMODEM.  Support for
	ZMODEM is growing, and I hope it will soon be adopted by all,
	especially the large networks.

	4  THE REST OF THE DOCUMENTATION
	
	This program sports a lot of features, and it deserves a manual
	of about 100 pages.  However, since like most programmers I don't
	like to write documentation, this is all you will get for now. 
	My firm conviction is that a good application program does not
	need much documentation, so I suspect you will not really need
	the manual if I have done a good job on the program.  If you are
	new to telecommunications, pick up a good book on the basics or
	get an experienced friend to help you and you should be able to
	get along.
	
	If you really get stuck, drop a line on GEnie to HMANEY, or via
	US Mail to the address above.
