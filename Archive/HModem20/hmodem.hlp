*************************  HELP for COMMAND LEVEL 1 ****************************

f1 - Receive a file using XMODEM, YMODEM, or ZMODEM protocols.  For XMODEM,
     the name of the file will be requested from you.  Otherwise, the file
     name and size are automatically obtained from the sending program.
     Files received will be stored on the default download disk as specified
     in the "Configure" function.

f2 - Turn the Log function on or off.  The Log automatically captures all
     incoming data in terminal mode and saves it to disk under the file name
     "HMODEM.LOG".  The disk is always the default download disk.  This
     function can provide a simple ASCII download capability.

f3 - Display the directory of the current default disk.  Use the Level 2
     "Disk" function to change the default disk.

f4 - Print the data currently showing on the screen.  There will be a pause
     of several seconds while the H-19 sends its screen contents to the
     computer.  After this transfer is complete, the H-19 will beep, and
     terminal mode will be resumed while the printer is printing in the
     background.

f5 - Send one or more files using ASCII, XMODEM, YMODEM, or ZMODEM protocols.
     When using ASCII or XMODEM protocols, you can send only one file at a
     time.  For YMODEM and ZMODEM protocols, you may specifiy a list of file
     names, separated by spaces, as well as use wild cards ("*" and "?").
     These files must all reside on the default disk, so do not specify the
     drive.

The following keys are the same in both Command Levels:

Erase - This key always puts the phone line on hook (hangs it up).  Use it
        carefully to avoid hanging up accidently.

Blue -  Toggle command level to Level 1 or Level 2.  The effect is to re-
        define some of the function keys to allow all HModem commands to
        be accommodated.  The labels on the status bar are also changed.

Red -   Help.  Print this screen.

White -   Exit HModem.  You will be given a chance to change your mind.  



*************************  HELP for COMMAND LEVEL 2 ****************************

f1 - Dial the telephone.  This functions displays the telephone directory
     and allows you to dial one or more numbers.  You may enter letters 
     designating numbers on the list displayed, or you may key in any
     phone numbers.  If you enter more than one number or letter, they must
     be separated by commas.  HModem will dial through the list until a
     connection is made.  If no connection is made, HModem will redial the
     list indefinitely or until you press the Escape key.

f2 - Enter the HModem Host mode.  You can abort at any time by pressing the
     Escape key.  There will always be a delay of several seconds when
     aborting in order to reinitialize the system.  Pressing the Escape key
     in the Host mode to abort a file transfer will not abort the Host mode
     until the Escape key is pressed a second time.

f3 - Configure HModem.  This functions calls the overlay "HCONFIG.COM" which
     must always reside on the disk from which HModem was invoked.  This 
     utility allows the user to change default parameters and edit the
     telephone directory and keypad macro library.

f4 - Toggle printer echo on or off.  When on, the letters "PR" appear on the
     status bar.  All incoming data in terminal mode is spooled to the printer
     through the printer buffer.  If the printer is too slow for the incoming
     data, some data may be lost, depending on the size of the print buffer
     selected by the user under the "Configure" function.

f5 - Disk functions.  This will allow you to change the default disk, swap
     a disk in any drive, or delete a file.

The following keys are the same in both Command Levels:

Erase - This key always puts the phone line on hook (hangs it up).  Use it
        carefully to avoid hanging up accidently.

Blue -  Toggle command level to Level 1 or Level 2.  The effect is to re-
        define some of the function keys to allow all HModem commands to
        be accommodated.  The labels on the status bar are also changed.

Red -   Help.  Print this screen.

White -   Exit HModem.  You will be given a chance to change your mind.
