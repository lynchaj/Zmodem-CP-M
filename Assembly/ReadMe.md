This is an alternate approach based on learning the original zr & sz binaries were actually produced using Z80 assembler.
These files represent a disassembly of the original rz & sz binaries using the IDAFW disassembler.  They assemble under TASM without error.
However the resulting binaries need to be byte for byte compared to the originals and any discrepancies fixed.
