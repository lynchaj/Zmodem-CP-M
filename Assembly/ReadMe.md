This is an alternate approach based on learning the original zr & sz binaries were actually produced using Z80 assembler.
These files represent a disassembly of the original rz & sz binaries using the IDAFW disassembler.  They assemble under TASM without error.
However the resulting binaries need to be byte for byte compared to the originals and any discrepancies fixed.

The Z80 assembler source code files for rz and sz have moved to the RomWBW repo also on GitHub and can be found here:
